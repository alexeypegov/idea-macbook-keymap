IntelliJ IDEA keymap optimized for Apple laptops
---------------------------------------------------

Some time ago I made some changes in the IDEA codebase to improve the usability of second keystrokes (i.e. pressing Command+R then R again). So I started to figure out a new keymap for the default MacBook layout (with special feature keys instead of function Fn keys, etc).

Changes within the second keystrokes include:

- Popup for available second keystrokes (press Command+R and wait a moment)
- Ability to press the second key with the exact same modifier key as the first one (i.e. pressing Command+R then Command+R is exactly the
same as Command+R then R)

I also like an idea of mnemonic rules, e.g. Command+R is for Refactorings, Command+F is for Find, Command+N is for Navigation.
